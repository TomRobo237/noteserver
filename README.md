# Notes server
Hosting a flask server on localhost because I've lost control of my life.  
Made as a side project to help with writing my notes quickly and putting them into jira at work, hence the inclusion of M2J from https://github.com/FokkeZB/J2M
enable venv and run app

    . /venv/bin/activate
      And either:
    ./app.py &
      or:
    flask run
